Hi! I've had good intentions to revamp my personal website for seemingly forever. Today I've finally given my own little corner of the interwebs a fresh coat of paint, knocked down a wall or two, and added some new HardiePlankÂ® siding. (My wife and I are currently on a [Fixer Upper](http://www.hgtv.com/shows/fixer-upper) tv show kick, so pardon the home renovation metaphors - they're flowing freely at the moment.)

Wordpress was heavier than I wanted for a simple bio & blog site like this, so this was the perfectly motivation to learn about static site frameworks. Popularized by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), static sites are all the rage among the developer ilk these days and it was time to join the party. Now that I've switched over full-time to a Javascript career path, something Node-based seemed right. I settled on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

So far, so good.

I'm using the excellent [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) theme with a few modifications, although I may roll my own theme at some point. Getting started has been pretty smooth.

Although [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are, understandably, extremely popular for hosting these kinds of static setups, I've been a heavy user of BitBucket for a while now. They too offer [static site hosting](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html), and [Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com/) offers some sweet upgrades to the hosting, with a free plan to boot. <del>So that's the direction I'm taking for now. The road less traveled and all that.</del> <b>UPDATE:</b><em> Turns out that Aerobatic's free plan offers hosting for two websites, but only provides custom domain support for one of them. That's a bummer because I really needed two custom domains. While Aerobatic offers a great service, I'm comfortable enough with hosting the sites in questions on my public GitHub repo so I rolled with GitHub pages after all.</em>

I'll be blogging here occasionally when it strikes my fancy. Usually something code-related since I'm frequently wrestling through some kind of coding issue, feverishly hunting for just the right StackOverflow thread to unlock my quandry. I'll try and pass on what I learn to my fellow travelers. If I blog about something non-coding, it'll probably be about parenting (we have an awesome little 9-month old), faith topics, home renovations, or Seattle pro sports, of which I am a long-time rabid fan. Oh, did I mention we're living in Seattle these days? It's great.

Hope to see you around.
