Having [transitioned](//ryanheathers.com/2016/01/25/hello-world/) my personal site to the Hexo website engine, it was high time to do the same for [FunnelCloud](//funnelcloudmarketing.com), my web development consultancy. I'd been rolling with a semi-custom Wordpress theme for a while now but was never really happy with it. It was time for a welcome change.

For now the site just needed to be a single-pager. Anything else was overkill, so that was another good reason to move off Wordpress. The narrow scope for the project afforded me the chance to work in a few fancier CSS animations and solidify my understanding of how they work under the hood. For a fun touch I also leveraged CSS's pseudo-elements to [create cool shapes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/).

One hurdle: static engines like Hexo, by defition, don't provide a database component and that can make adding common website functionality like a Contact form a little harder. I couldn't find a Hexo plugin to just drop in, but a little googling pointed me at [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). A little configuration and a fair chunk of custom JQuery later, I was pleased with the slick contact form experience I was able to create. You can see it in action on the [FunnelCloud site](//funnelcloudmarketing.com). Formspree makes a really nice little service, and the best part is that it's completely free when you have less than 1000 contact form fills a month.

Overall a fun little project with some good learnings!
